## Learning Path

This project follows a structured learning path. Each section focuses on a specific Flutter concept with tasks and references to deepen understanding.

### 1. Folder Structure

Understanding the proper folder structure is crucial for scaling Flutter applications.

### 4. BLoC Pattern

Implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.

  - [The Best Flutter Bloc Complete Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr7P7lMIUTuvDBbmq66Kwz_OEt_7U9fLH)

#### Task 1: Movie App

**Points to Remember:**

1. Use the BLoC pattern to integrate data inside the app.
2. Use a proper folder structure.
3. Create light and dark themes managed by a button in the sidebar.
4. Use TMDB (The Movie Database) API for movie data.
5. Handle network connectivity; show a message when offline and update when back online.
6. Handle network connection using network streams.
7. Create two screens:
   - Movies card by category list.
   - Particular movie details.

- **References:**
  - [Shared Preferences in Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQNFQ3y6UY)

#### Task 3: Blog App

**Points to Remember:**

1. Create login and signup pages; connect and save data in Firebase Storage.
2. Integrate Google Sign-In with a dedicated button.
3. Save user data in Firebase; if the user is new, or show an "existing member" alert message.
4. After login, save user data in Shared Preferences; don't show the login screen until the user logs out.
5. Create a blog form with fields: title, description, category, tags, image URL.
6. Create two screens:
   - All blogs.
   - Logged-in user's blogs with a "Create Blog" button.
   - Show home screen blogs as per category.
7. Handle routing and navigation using GetX.
8. Make the app web and mobile responsive.

## How to Use This Project

The main.dart file is structured to allow you to run different parts of the project by uncommenting specific sections of code. Each section corresponds to a particular learning topic or task.

**Example:**

```dart
//-------------------------------------------------------------------- BLOC FORM VALIDATION (EP-3) --------------------------------------------------------------
// void main() {
//   runApp(MyApp());
// }
//
// class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
//   const MyApp({super.key});
//
//   @override
//   State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
// }
//
// class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
//   @override
//   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
//     return const MaterialApp(
//       debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
//       home: WelcomeScreen(),
//     );
//   }
//}
```

To run the theme example:

1. Uncomment the code under the ENABLE FOR THEME section.
2. Comment out other sections to avoid conflicts.
3. Run the app using `flutter run`.

**Similarly, you can run other examples:**

- **Responsive Layout:**

```dart
// ------------------------------------------------ FOR RESPONSIVE LAYOUT ------------------------------------------

// void main() {
//   runApp(MyApp());
// }

// class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
//   @override
//   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
//     return MaterialApp(
//       home: LayoutOne(),
//     );
//  

 }
// }
```
